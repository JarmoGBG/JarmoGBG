- 👋 Hi, I’m @JarmoGBG
- 👀 I’m interested in almost everything, computers, coding, silversmithing & crocheting
- 
- 🌱 I’m currently studying a C# .Net continuation course. To refresh my knowledge and learn about frontend, bootstrap, Azure and so forth
- 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that seems interesting and fun
- 📫 How to reach me message me here? Scream my name from a mountain top?
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him/You/Anything that gets my attention. Im not too picky.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've never been a animal person, and my GF very much is. She really wanted a cat and I was firmly against 
I didn't want to share apartment with a animal or anything to do with them.
My aversion against animals can probably be boiled down to three incidents:
 • A mean swan that hit me prettt hard with his beak
   and took a whole lot of interference by my mother before the swan finally gave up. I was like 3 years, give or take a year.
  • Next animal who had something against me was a dog who thought I would be a good chewing toy
  • And the final culprit was a cat in finlad who gave me a serious beating while I was just playing in a sandlot and bothering none.
  So there we have the bascis for me not being too keen on bringing in wildlife to where I live.
I lost, but before she got the cat I was very firm that I would not take care of that Cat, it was her sole responsility.

And so it was. Atleast the first 4-5 min after the cat came to live with us. Then my heart melted totally & since then im such a sucker for that cat, or Liston as I named him pretty quickly.

He is now almost 4 years old and yes, I want atleast one more. I never thought I would be a cat person,
but apparently I am.
